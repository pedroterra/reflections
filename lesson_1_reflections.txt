>How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff pin point tht location of what was differente between the two files. so it was extremely easy to complete the task

>How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it would be easy test new ideias with out losing older versions that work. furthermore one could create multiple versions in parallel.

>What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: only saves after complete logical changes. estimulates more intentional savings
cons: saves more work in cases of acindental shutdown. automates process

>Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
for projects where you need changes migth affect multiples files this is super important. it gives you a complete snapshop of the project at a certain point.

>How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will give me all the commits made in the project. git diff will compare 2 specific commits e show me the differences

>How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I know that now I can easely find where are the bugs

>Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
all my projects from udacity
