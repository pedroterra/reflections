>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if it's possible I would always prefere to use the remote repository although it migth be usefull for companies to have theirs
repositories locally.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if the pull is automatically maybe to files saved aren't logically complete ans this migth make hard for the user to understand whats happening

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks copies a git in GitHub and creates a repository where i can make the modifications I want. clones copies repositories. branches are variations or versions of one projects that can eventually be integrated in the master branch

>What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
the benefit is that I can work without too much worry of creating conflicting files.

>How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I probably would work in the same room as the other person and share the same computer ;)
