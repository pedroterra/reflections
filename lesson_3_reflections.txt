>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if it's possible I would always prefere to use the remote repository although it migth be usefull for companies to have theirs
repositories locally.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if the pull is automatically maybe to files saved aren't logically complete ans this migth make hard for the user to understand whats happening
