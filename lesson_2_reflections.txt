>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a place where to save metadata about the commits anc changes in the file

>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
is the place where you focos on the possible commits you want to make as for working directory is more o experimentation

I can use git status to check how many files are there? not sure though

>What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I can create different versions of the game without runing a previous working file

>How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can see how every branch relates to each other and wich commit is reachable by a specific branch

>What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
mergiging 2 branches result in the combination of the master branc with an specific branch. in the diagram we represent as two different patch combining into one

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
it's great because it only automatic merge when there is no conflict. manual is prompt when you have to re analize the code been submited
